# React Testing

TODO

- Jest and React Testing Library
- Fundamentals of writing a test
- Test components with user interactions
- Test components wrapped in a provider
- Test components with mocking
- Static analysis testing

## Install Jest

```
yarn add -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

## Jest vs React Testing Library

### Jest

- Javascript testing framework.
- A test runner that finds tests, runs the tests, determines whether the tests passed or failed and reports it back in a human readable manner# React Testing

### Jest

### RTL

- JS testing utility that provides virtual DOM for testing React components.
- RTL provides a virtual DOM which we can use to interact with and verify the behaviour of a react component
- Testing Library is infact a family of packages which helps test UI components
- The core library is called DOM testing library and RTL is simply a wrapper around this core library to test React applications in an easier way

## Types of Tests

### Unit Test

- Focus is on testing the individual building blocks of an application such as a class or a functions or components
- Each unit or building block is tested in isolation, independent of other units
- Dependencies are mocked
- Run in a short amount of time and make it very easy to pinpoint failures

### Integration Test

- Focus is on testing a combination of units and ensuring they work together

### E2E Test

- Focus is on testing the entire application flow and ensuring it works as designed from start to finish
- Involves in a real UI, a real backed database, real services etc
